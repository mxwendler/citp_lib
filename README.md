Controller Interface Transport Protocol Library
===============================================

Library to allow easy use of the Controller Interface Transport Protcol (CITP) used in the Capture lighting visualizer.
Started by John Warwick, originally based on the Qt 4.5 framework, ported to standard c++ and wxwidgets.

This code is written to exercise a [Wireshark](http://wireshark.org) protocol dissector, but might be more generally useful if you want to stream data to a lighting visualizer.

Complete protocol documentation available at [CITP-Protocol.org](http://www.citp-protocol.org/).
